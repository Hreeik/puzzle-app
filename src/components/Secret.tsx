                        Congratulations on solving the puzzle! You've unlocked this hidden page.
                        This is a special place that only those who complete the puzzle can discover.

                        The puzzle you solved is more than just a game - it's a metaphor for life's challenges.
                        Each piece represents a step in your journey, and just like in life, sometimes pieces
                        need to be moved around before they find their perfect place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember: Every challenge you face is like a puzzle piece. It might not seem to fit at first,
                        but with patience and persistence, you'll find its perfect place in your life's picture.
                    </p>
